1. 🛡️ Scratch-Resistant Coating
Prompt:
3D cinematic split-shot of two spectacle lenses on a textured surface: one staying flawless (Specatcle Lens), the other showing visible scratches (standard lens). Add soft side lighting.

2. 🌟 Anti-Glare Coating
Prompt:
Realistic 3D side-by-side scene: both lenses show a phone under bright LED light. The Specatcle Lens shows no glare or reflection; the standard lens reflects the harsh light.

3. 🔵 Blue-Violet Light Filter
Prompt:
Cinematic 3D comparison: a person using a laptop at night with both lenses in view. Blue-violet light bounces off the Specatcle Lens with a soft glow, while it passes through the standard lens.

4. 💧 Hydrophobic (Water Repellent) Coating
Prompt:
Close-up 3D render showing two lenses in light rain: water beads up and rolls off the Specatcle Lens; the standard lens has smears and wet patches. Soft natural light, shallow depth of field.

5. 🌬️ Anti‑Static Dust Repellent
Prompt:
3D side-by-side close-up: dust particles hover or lift off the Specatcle Lens while settling onto the standard lens. Subtle airflow motion blur, clean tabletop background.

6. 🌞 100% UV Protection
Prompt:
Outdoor 3D portrait showing two people wearing lenses under sunlight: a UV meter next to each shows full protection for the Specatcle Lens and partial for the standard lens.

7. 🕶️ Photochromic (Light-Adaptive)
Prompt:
3D split-screen showing the same Specatcle Lens indoors (clear) and outdoors under sunlight (darkened). Include a regular lens that stays unchanged under both conditions.

“Adapts to changing light for all-day comfort.”

8. 🤏 Oleophobic Smudge Resistance
Prompt:
Macro 3D shot comparing two lenses after being touched. The Specatcle Lens stays spotless while the standard lens shows fingerprint smears.

“Oleophobic coating resists fingerprints and smudges.”

9. 🦾 Impact‑Resistant (Unbreakable)
Prompt:
High-speed 3D render of a metal ball hitting two lenses: the Specatcle Lens absorbs the impact without damage, while the standard lens shatters. Include slow-motion particles and lighting effects.

“Impact‑resistant for enhanced safety and durability.”

10. ✨ Low‑Reflection
Prompt:
3D eye chart viewed through two lenses: the Specatcle Lens is clear and easy to read with minimal reflections, the standard lens shows reflections obscuring letters.

“Reduces glare for clearer vision and less eye strain.”

11. 🚗 DrivePlus (UV & Scratch)
Prompt:
POV 3D shot from inside a car at sunset through two dashboard-mounted lenses: Specatcle Lens shows a sharp, glare-free road; standard lens shows light flares and smudging.
Overlay text:
“DrivePlus: Enhanced UV protection and scratch resistance.”

12. 💡 Essential Blue Light Transmission
Prompt:
Create a realistic, cinematic 3d image with a lens placed exactly at the center. A single horizontal ray of mixed blue-violet light is traveling from left to right through the image. Do not include any visible light source—only show the ray itself. When the ray reaches the lens, the darker violet-blue part of the ray is blocked or reflected at the surface, while the lighter blue or turquoise part is shown passing through the lens and continuing to the right. The image should visually highlight the lens’s ability to filter harmful blue-violet light while allowing beneficial light to pass through.
